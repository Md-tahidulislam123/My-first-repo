    <p>Omeprazole belongs to a new class of anti secratory compound, substitued benzimidazole. It is a specific inhibitor of the gastric proton pump (H+/K+-ATPase) in the pariental cell. It produces dose dependent inhibition of gastric acid secretin by binding to the enzyme effectively. With 20 mg once daily dose produces inhibition of gastric acid secretin within 1-2 hours of the first dose. The maximum effect is achieved within 4 days.<br>
    Omeprazole is almost completely metabolized in the liver and rapidly eliminated in the urine. The elimination half-life is about 0.5 to 1.5 hours Omeprazole is highly bound(95%) to plasma proteins.</p>
